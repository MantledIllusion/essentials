# VAADIN Flow FilterBar

The **_FilterBar_** is a component that can be elegantly used above displayed data that can be filtered somehow, like a **_Grid_**.

Upon clicking its only **_Button_**, it opens a **_Dialog_** where the user can enter a free-form one line text, which will be automatically analyzed and split into a recognized pattern matching exactly definable filter criteria.
